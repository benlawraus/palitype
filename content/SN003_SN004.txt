The deva sang:
v=
    i=sn1.3:2.1
    e=Flowing past, life is short;
    p=Upanīyati jīvitamappamāyu,=.
    i=sn1.3:2.2
    e=No escape from growing old.
    p=Jarūpanītassa na santi tāṇā;=.
    i=sn1.3:2.3
    e=With this danger of death in sight,
    p=Etaṁ bhayaṁ maraṇe pekkhamāno,=.
    i=sn1.3:2.3
    e=We should do good to bring happiness.
    p=Puññāni kayirātha sukhāvahānī.=.

The Buddha replied,
v=
    i=sn1.3:3.1
    e=Flowing past, life is short;
    p=Upanīyati jīvitamappamāyu,=.
    i=sn1.3:3.2
    e=No escape from growing old.
    p=Jarūpanītassa na santi tāṇā;=.
    i=sn1.3:3.3
    e=With this danger of death in sight,
    p=Etaṁ bhayaṁ maraṇe pekkhamāno,=.
    i=sn1.3:3.4
    e=Ignore the world allure and seek peace.
    p=Lokāmisaṁ pajahe santipekkho=.

It is ironic that the last day of a person's life could be the only day that person actually lived.
Most of the time we are gone, not really here, even though our body is here and our eyes are seeing and
ears are hearing.  But usually what we are seeing and hearing isn't here but in the thinking where we have gone.

Imagine this instead: this is the last day the whole world will exist, tomorrow Earth will be no more.
What is there to think about now?

If we choose the Deva's path, we will be giving what we have, no bad speech,
being kind and loving and doing only good.

If we choose Lord Buddha's path, we will not be tempted to insatiate ourselves, but instead,
be mindful of our thoughts and seek peace in our mind.

Believe it in or not, when we die, everything we know and remember will also die.
Do you remember anything from your life before this one? Everything we see and hear and remember and
the people we know and love and hate, all will be gone too when we die. The whole Earth might as well be
destroyed. We can never go back again.

On another night, a deva came to see Lord Buddha, and declared:
v=
    i=sn1.4:2.1
    e=Time flies, nights pass by,
    p=Accenti kālā tarayanti rattiyo,=.
    i=sn1.4:2.2
    e=the stages of life leave us one by one.
    p=Vayoguṇā anupubbaṁ jahanti;=.
    i=sn1.4:2.3
    e=Seeing this peril in death,
    p=Etaṁ bhayaṁ maraṇe pekkhamāno,=.
    i=sn1.4:2.4
    e=Do good deeds that bring you to joy.
    p=Puññāni kayirātha sukhāvahānī=.

The Buddha replied,
v=
    i=sn1.4:3.1
    e=Time flies, nights pass by,
    p=Accenti kālā tarayanti rattiyo,=.
    i=sn1.4:3.2
    e=Stages of life fall one by one.
    p=Vayoguṇā anupubbaṁ jahanti;=.
    i=sn1.4:3.3
    e=With this danger of death in sight,
    p=Etaṁ bhayaṁ maraṇe pekkhamāno,=.
    i=sn1.4:3.4
    e=Ignore the world's allure and seek peace.
    p=Lokāmisaṁ pajahe santipekkho=.

The world's allure, beckoning in every waking moment and haunting in sleep, is in our eyes and ears, on our tongue
and between the sheets. Seems impossible to ignore. The allure is one thing, the experience of having that pleasure is
another.

The mind is showing you advertisements, in the form of thoughts about the wonderful attractions and future pleasures.
p=Lokāmisaṁ pajahe f= is saying e= "Ignore the ads"=.. Live a life without these ads playing in your brain. Instead, keep
the peace each moment gives.
